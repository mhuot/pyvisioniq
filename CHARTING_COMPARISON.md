## Recommendation: Chart.js

For PyVisionic, **Chart.js** is the best choice because:

1. **Lightweight**: 60x smaller than Plotly.js
2. **Mobile-first**: Excellent touch support and performance
3. **Easy migration**: Similar concepts to Plotly
4. **Gap handling**: Native support for null values in line charts
5. **All required charts**: Line, bar, and pie charts included
6. **Active community**: Well-maintained with plugins

## Implementation Requirements
